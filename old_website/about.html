    <h2>What is Snap! Below the Line?</h2>
    <p class="about">Snap! is the visual programming language used to teach computer science in CS10 and around the world. This DeCal will give you the experience to collaborate on a large codebase and prepares you for making important and influential changes to the Snap! language. Any interested student will learn from and enjoy this course.</p>
  
    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
    <p class="about">By the end of this course, students should be comfortable with JavaScript and Github and be able to navigate the Snap! source code. Students will learn how Snap! runs and operates. Students will learn how to make changes to Snap! and complete a change of their own. Students will be ready to join and contribute to the Snap! Development Team.</p>
  
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <p class="about">Instruction will primarily consist of lectures and hands-on instruction from your facilitators, CS10 instructors, and Snap! Development team alumni. There will be additional office hour time for students to get help and keep learning - this will be optional, but recommended.</p>
  
    <h2>Weekly Assignments and Readings</h2>
    <p class="about">Short assignments and readings will be given in the first few weeks, culminating in a larger final project. One assignment will be a blog that responds to the readings in an interactive way. This class will require the use of a computer. If you need access, let a facilitator know.</p>
  
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p class="about">Lectures will be mandatory to pass the class. Excused absences are acceptable - if you need to miss a lecture, please contact the facilitators at least one day prior to the class.</p>
    <p class="about">Office hours are strongly, strongly encouraged. The best learning happens with 1:1 interaction - and you will likely have questions outside of the lectures. There are many of us in the community here to help! Feel free to contact a facilitator and we can set up times to meet, eat, and learn.</p>

    <h2>Topics</h2>
    <ul class="topics">
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Git and GitHub</li>
      <li>How to get started with a large codebase</li>
      <li>The Snap! framework (morphic.js)</li>
      <li>History, current issues, and future direction of Snap!</li>
      <li>Final Project</li>
      <li>How to contribute to Snap!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p class="about">This course can only be taken as a P/NP basis. All assignments will be graded on effort and completion - students are expected to complete each one.  More than one unexcused absence or missed assignment will result in an NP.</p>
    <p class="about">We grade each assignment based on the effort that was put into completing each assignment. In order to pass the class, you must put a decent amount of effort in completing EVERY assignment.</p>

    <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
    <p class="about">Much of this class will involve collaboration, but you should do your own work. Cheating will result in a zero on that assignment and will be reported to Student Judicial Affairs.</p>
